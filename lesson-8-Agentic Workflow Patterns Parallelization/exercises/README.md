# Agentic Workflow Exercise with Parallel Enterprise Contract Analysis

Exercise: Building a Parallel Enterprise Contract Analysis System
In this exercise, you'll implement a parallel agentic workflow for an enterprise contract analysis system that helps legal teams efficiently review and assess complex business agreements.

## Exercise Overview
You'll build a system with three specialized agents that run concurrently:

**Legal Terms Checker Agent:** Analyzes contract language and identifies problematic legal clauses
**Compliance Validator Agent:** Verifies that contracts meet regulatory and industry compliance standards
**Financial Risk Assessor Agent:** Evaluates potential financial risks and liabilities in the contract

The system will use a Summary Agent to synthesize the findings from all three agents into a comprehensive contract analysis report.

## Parallel Agentic Workflow Exercise: Enterprise Contract Analysis
In this exercise, you'll build a parallel agentic workflow system that analyzes enterprise contracts from multiple perspectives simultaneously. This system will help legal teams quickly identify potential issues in complex business agreements.

## Your Task
You need to implement:

Three specialized agent classes that can analyze contracts in parallel:

LegalTermsChecker: Identifies problematic legal clauses and terms
ComplianceValidator: Checks for regulatory and industry compliance issues
FinancialRiskAssessor: Evaluates potential financial risks and liabilities


A SummaryAgent class that synthesizes findings from all three specialized agents
The analyze_contract function that orchestrates parallel execution and returns a comprehensive analysis

Your implementation should demonstrate key principles of parallel agentic workflows:

Concurrent execution of independent tasks
Thread-safe data collection
Result synthesis from multiple specialized perspectives

## Starting Point

I've provided starter code that includes:

A threading framework for parallel agent execution
A sample contract for testing
Empty agent class definitions
A main section that runs the analysis system

## Expected Functionality

When provided with a contract, your system should:

Simultaneously run all three specialized agents to analyze different aspects of the contract
Collect their findings in a thread-safe manner
Pass all findings to the Summary Agent for synthesis
Generate a comprehensive contract analysis report

The parallel execution should significantly reduce the total processing time compared to sequential analysis.
Implementation Steps

Complete each specialized agent class to analyze its specific aspect of the contract
Implement the SummaryAgent to synthesize all findings into a coherent report
Create the analyze_contract function to:

Instantiate all agents
Run the specialized agents in parallel using threads
Collect their outputs
Generate a final summary report


## Example Solution

I've provided a complete solution that demonstrates how these components should work. Study it to understand the expected behavior, but I encourage you to implement your own version.
When you're done, your system should efficiently analyze contracts from multiple perspectives in parallel and produce a comprehensive report.

## Student Assignment

Your task is to implement the three specialized agent classes and the analyze_contract function that enables parallel processing. Focus on:

- Setting up appropriate system prompts for each specialist agent
- Implementing the parallel execution mechanism using threading
- Creating a thread-safe way to collect results from each agent
- Designing an effective prompt for the summary agent to synthesize findings
