Program Management Knowledge Agent Exercise

The Exercise
The exercise asks learners to implement two main functions:

get_hardcoded_answer(): Returns predefined answers for common program management questions
get_llm_answer(): Makes an API call to an LLM to get dynamic answers

The code is much simpler than my first version and focuses specifically on comparing these two approaches.
Materials Provided

Exercise Description: Brief overview of requirements and learning objectives
Solution Code: Complete implementation showing both functions working
Starter Code: Template with TODOs for students to complete

Key Learning Points

Creating a simple knowledge base with hardcoded answers
Setting up and making API calls to an LLM
Comparing the strengths and limitations of each approach
Understanding when to use static versus dynamic knowledge sources

Usage
The solution code includes a comparison function that lets users see answers from both approaches side-by-side. This helps illustrate the differences in:

Coverage (hardcoded can only answer specific questions)
Consistency (hardcoded answers are always the same)
Flexibility (LLM can answer a wider range of questions)
Control (hardcoded answers can be carefully curated)

This exercise is simple enough for beginners but introduces important concepts about knowledge systems and AI integration.
