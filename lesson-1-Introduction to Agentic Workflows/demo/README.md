This Python script demonstrates the conceptual similarity between traditional Python functions and OpenAI-powered agents by showing how both take input, process it, and return output. It includes two core components: a traditional_generate_response() function that returns canned responses based on simple keyword matching, and an openai_generate_response() function that uses the OpenAI API to generate dynamic, natural language responses to user queries. Environment variables, specifically the OpenAI API key, are securely loaded using the dotenv library, allowing the script to access the OpenAI service without hardcoding credentials. The script iterates through a list of sample queries, printing responses from both the traditional logic and (optionally) the AI-powered agent, helping users understand how basic programming constructs relate to more advanced AI-based tools.
