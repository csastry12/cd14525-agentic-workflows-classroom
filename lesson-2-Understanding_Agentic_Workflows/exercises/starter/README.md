# Exercise: Build Your First Agents – Deterministic & LLM-Based Workout Planner

In this exercise, you’ll design two workout planner agents for a fitness application:

**Agent 1:** Deterministic Planner (you’ll write the full logic)

**Agent 2:** LLM-Based Planner (you’ll craft the prompt only)

You'll compare how each agent creates a workout plan for users based on their fitness level, goals, preferences, and limitations.

## Your Tasks
Implement the deterministic_agent: use simple rules based on fitness level, goals, and preferences to fill the workout schedule.

Write the LLM prompt instructions: inside the prompt string, explain to the model how to format the output and what kind of plan to generate.

Run the script to see how your two agents compare!
